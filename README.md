1. User Input: The program prompts users to enter the total bill amount, the desired tip percentage (10, 12, or 15), and the number of people to split the bill among.

2. Tip Calculation: The program calculates the tip amount by converting the inputted tip percentage into a decimal and then multiplying it by the total bill amount.
